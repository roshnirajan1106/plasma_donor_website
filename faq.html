									<p>COVID-19 most commonly spreads during close contact
										• People who are physically near (within 6 feet) a person with COVID-19 or have direct
										contact with that person are at greatest risk of infection.
										• When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce
										respiratory droplets. These droplets can range in size from larger droplets (some of
										which are visible) to smaller droplets. Small droplets can also form particles when they
										dry very quickly in the airstream.
		
		
										• Infections occur mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets when a person is in
										close contact with someone who has COVID-19.
										• Respiratory droplets cause infection when they are inhaled or deposited on mucous
										membranes, such as those that line the inside of the nose and mouth.
										• As the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the
										concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to
										gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air.
										• With passing time, the amount of infectious virus in respiratory droplets also
										decreases.</p>

									<p>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. You can take
										steps to slow the spread.
										• Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and others.
										• Stay 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you.
										• Get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.
										• Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces.
										• Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t
										available.
										• Stay home and isolate from others when sick.
										• Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and take other steps to stop
										the spread at home.</p>

									<p>CCP is procured from recovered patients (e.g., prospective donors),
										who donate at blood centres or other collection centres.
										These blood collection organizations then test the plasma for SARS-CoV-2
										antibody levels and standard infectious disease markers before releasing the plasma for
										clinical use.
										Some centres use availability of screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels to incentivize
										donors.
										Plasmapheresis is desirable as a means to collect large volumes of plasma.
										Clinical assays that measure the level of antibodies reacting against various SARS-CoV-2
										proteins are widely available and may correlate, albeit imperfectly, with neutralizing
										antibody titers, and thus might be used to predict the potency of CCP units (data on
										this relationship continue to evolve). It is important to consider the assay platform as
										well as the specificity (e.g., reactive with spike protein vs. nucleocapsid)
										and the class of antibody (IgG vs. total) when evaluating results, given major
										differences reported for
										available commercial serologic assays regarding correlations with neutralizing antibody
										activity.</p>
