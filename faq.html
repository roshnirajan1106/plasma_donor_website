						<div class="text-component">
							<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by
								a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
								(SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of
								respiratory
								illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.</p>

					<div class="cd-faq__content">
						<div class="text-component">
							<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
								Common symptoms include headache, loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny
								nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever, diarrhoea, and breathing difficulties.
								People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may
								change over time. </p>

					<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>How COVID-19 Spreads?</span></a>
					<div class="cd-faq__content">
						<div class="text-component">
							<p>COVID-19 most commonly spreads during close contact
								• People who are physically near (within 6 feet) a person with COVID-19 or have direct
								contact with that person are at greatest risk of infection.
								• When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce
								respiratory droplets. These droplets can range in size from larger droplets (some of
								which are visible) to smaller droplets. Small droplets can also form particles when they
								dry very quickly in the airstream.


								• Infections occur mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets when a person is in
								close contact with someone who has COVID-19.
								• Respiratory droplets cause infection when they are inhaled or deposited on mucous
								membranes, such as those that line the inside of the nose and mouth.
								• As the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the
								concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to
								gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air.
								• With passing time, the amount of infectious virus in respiratory droplets also
								decreases.

					<div class="cd-faq__content">
						<div class="text-component">
							<p>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. You can take
								steps to slow the spread.
								• Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and others.
								• Stay 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you.
								• Get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.
								• Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces.
								• Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t
								available.
								• Stay home and isolate from others when sick.
								• Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and take other steps to stop
								the spread at home.

					<div class="cd-faq__content">
						<div class="text-component">
							<p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including
								some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

							<p>• Continue taking care of your health and wellness
								• Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to

								• Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you.

								• Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other

					<div class="cd-faq__content">
						<div class="text-component">
							<p>Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the
								virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from
								domestic or international mail, products, or packaging. However, it may be possible that
								people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and
								then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
								but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

						<div class="text-component">
							<p>• It appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals in
								some situations. A small number of pets worldwide, including cats and dogs, reported to

								with COVID-19.
								• At this time, the risk of COVID-19 spreading from animals to people is low.

					<div class="cd-faq__content">
						<div class="text-component">
							<p>Plasma therapy is a medical procedure that uses the blood of a recovered patient to
								create antibodies on those infected individuals. Medically known as convalescent plasma
								therapy,
								this treatment uses antibodies found in the blood taken from a recovered Covid-19
								patient. It is then used to treat those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection to aid

					<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>How is CCP collected?</span></a>
					<div class="cd-faq__content">
						<div class="text-component">
							<p>CCP is procured from recovered patients (e.g., prospective donors),
								who donate at blood centres or other collection centres.
								These blood collection organizations then test the plasma for SARS-CoV-2
								antibody levels and standard infectious disease markers before releasing the plasma for
								clinical use.
								Some centres use availability of screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels to incentivize
								donors.
								Plasmapheresis is desirable as a means to collect large volumes of plasma.
								Clinical assays that measure the level of antibodies reacting against various SARS-CoV-2
								proteins are widely available and may correlate, albeit imperfectly, with neutralizing
								antibody titers, and thus might be used to predict the potency of CCP units (data on
								this relationship continue to evolve). It is important to consider the assay platform as
								well as the specificity (e.g., reactive with spike protein vs. nucleocapsid)
								and the class of antibody (IgG vs. total) when evaluating results, given major
								differences reported for
								available commercial serologic assays regarding correlations with neutralizing antibody
								activity.</p>
