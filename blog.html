								<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by a novel
									coronavirus
									called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called
									2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases
									in
									Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.</p>
								<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src="images/wuhan_img.jpg"></div>
								<h3>SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19:</h3>
								<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
									Common symptoms include headache, loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and
									runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever, diarrhoea, and breathing
									difficulties. People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their
									symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been
									identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath,
									and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache,
									and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and
									diarrhoea. In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste
									combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19.</p>
								<p>Most people (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14%
									develop severe symptoms (dyspnoea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on
									imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or
									multiorgan dysfunction).At least a third of the people who are infected with the
									virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time. These asymptomatic
									carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease. Other infected people
									will develop symptoms later, called "pre-symptomatic", or have very mild symptoms
									and can also spread the virus.</p>
								<h3>PLASMA THERAPY:</h3>
								<p>Plasma therapy is a medical procedure that uses the blood of a recovered patient to
									create antibodies on those infected individuals. Medically known as convalescent
									plasma therapy, this treatment uses antibodies found in the blood taken from a
									recovered Covid-19 patient. It is then used to treat those with severe SARS-CoV-2
									infection to aid recovery.</p>
								<h4>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h4>
								<p>A convalescent plasma therapy uses antibodies (a type of protein i.e produced by
									plasma) from patients who have completely recovered from COVID-19 infection. Here is
									how this procedure will fight coronavirus in your body.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Blood is taken from a previously infected but completely recovered patient,
										the plasma component of that blood is separated and that contains the antibodies
										against SARS-CoV-2 virus. This plasma is injected into an infected person’s body
										that will fight the virus and neutralise it from spreading.</li>
									<li>Once the patient has recovered, he/she will be asked to donate their blood so
										that their antibodies will be used to treat other infected patients.</li>
									<li>The blood sample will be checked for any existing harmful diseases such as
										Hepatitis B & C including HIV.</li>
									<li>The recovered blood will be taken into study and a researcher will extract
										plasma from the blood that can be injected into an infected person.</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src="images/plasma_img.jpg"></div>
								<h4>How to Prepare for the Treatment?</h4>
								<p>Firstly, a doctor will recommend a convalescent plasma treatment that is suitable for
									your blood type. Here’s how you need to prepare before treatment and what you must
									do after treatment.</p>
								<u1>
									<li>Before Treatment</li>
									<p>Your healthcare professional will assess your health before you undergo the
										treatment. This procedure involves a health care member who will insert an
										intravenous/ IV tube into a vein on your arms.</p>
									<li>During Treatment</li>
									<p>The recovered plasma from a recovered infected person will be attached to the IV
										tube and supplied to you in drips. It takes 2hours for the procedure to be
										completed.</p>
									<li>After Treatment</li>
									<p>You will be monitored by your healthcare specialist and you will have to make
										frequent visits to the hospital for further assessment by the doctor. Depending
										on your overall health, your healthcare specialist will decide if you require
										further hospitalisation or not.</p>
